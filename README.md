# GraphicsSystem
My Graphics System and an articulated model traveling through a path

In the following project, you will find my graphics system.

In this simulation, an articulated model is animated using the VQS (vector, quaternion, scalar) technique.

The main entry of the program is in the main.cpp file.

The scene is updated and initialized in the file GraphycSystemScene.cpp (this is an extension of the GraphycSystem, that allows to abstract the code that is dependant of the simulation to the code of the engine
